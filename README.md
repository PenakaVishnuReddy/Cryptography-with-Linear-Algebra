# Cryptography-with-Linear-Algebra
Cryptography is one of the most important applications of linear algebra and number theory where the process is to change important information to another unclear one. The main goal of cryptography is to keep the integrity and security of this information.
There are many types of cryptography techniques and we considered one of them in this project . In the project , we first mention some necessary definitions , theorems and some known results that will be needed . We showed some important proofs in modular arithmetic and groups.
We review the Division algorithm theorem, study the addition and multiplication modulo n , and finally after defining the notion of a (group) ; we give the conditions for a set to be a group. Finally , the cryptography techniques that use linear algebra. 
The most important type here is the Hill Cipher method, which uses theencryption algorithm. The programming tool used was MATLAB .
